1. Implement sphere tracing of a sphere yourself
1. [sphere tracing.glsl](sphere tracing.glsl)
	1. Move the camera (wasd+mouse-drag)
	1. Look at [camera.glsl](libs/camera.glsl)
	1. Add box(es)
	1. Add operators
	1. Add multiple spheres
	1. Add distance fog
	1. Add some lighting
1. [sphere tracing lit spheres.glsl](sphere tracing lit spheres.glsl)
	1. Look at the two ways for calculation of normal
1. [shadertoy/sphere repetition.glsl](shadertoy/sphere repetition.glsl)
	1. Try to understand the shading code
1. [sphere tracing building.glsl](sphere tracing building.glsl)
	1. Look at operator use
1. [sphere tracing wavy.glsl](sphere tracing wavy.glsl)
	1. Look at versions of fog (uncomment line i, line ii, different tmax)
	1. Look at space warp and change it; apply it only to plane/spheres (line iii)
1. [shadertoy/mystery box 3.glsl](shadertoy/mystery box 3.glsl)
	1. Try to understand twist operator and use it in your own scene
1. [sphere tracing 3D noise.glsl](sphere tracing 3D noise.glsl)
	1. Move downward
	1. Change line i; start with the y multiplier;
	1. This is not a valid distance field; note the artifacts;
	1. Change line ii, for a different location based color;
